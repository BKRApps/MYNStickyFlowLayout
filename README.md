## Installation

MYNStickyFlowLayout is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "MYNStickyFlowLayout", :git => 'https://github.com/paramaggarwal/MYNStickyFlowLayout.git'

Alternatively, you can just drag the files from `MYNStickyFlowLayout / Classes` into your own project.

## Usage

To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Project directory first.

Configure your collection view to use `MYNStickyFlowLayout`. Here's an example on how you to do it in Storyboard.

Now all your **section headers** will get the sticky effect like table view. You can disable it with one line of code.
